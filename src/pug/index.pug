      p 
        |This website is an exploration of the features and implementation of CSS3. The website aims to describe in words, code, and implementation many of the most prominent and useful features of CSS3. Much of the content of this website is inspired by the information from 
        em The Book of CSS3, 2nd Edition
        |  by Peter Gasston. The book is 
        a(href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-CSS3-2nd-Developers-Future/dp/1593275803" target="_blank") available for purchase
        |  at amazon.com.

      h2 Code Examples

      p 
        |Conventions used to make examples and descriptions on this website include inline code snippets, such as
        code body { background-color: #F00; }
        |to display code in the flow of the text.

      p
        |For more substantial code, extending over multiple lines, the preformatted element
        code pre
        | is used to display the code as a separate block to make it easier to read. For example:

      pre
        span CSS
        |
        |body {
        |   background-color: red;
        |}

      +formatCssCode("CSS", "body {", "margin: 10px", "padding: 0", "background-color: red;", "border: 1px solid #000;", "}")

      p
        |All the code including HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this website is coded from scratch without the use of any frameworks. This allow focus on the features of CSS3 without external code getting in the way.
